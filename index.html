            <p>Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Everybody needs a friend. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.</p>

            <p>A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. Let's get crazy. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.</p>

            <p>Talent is a pursued interest. That is to say, anything you practice you can do. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>

            <p>Anything you want to do you can do here. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now. Here's something that's fun. It's all a game of angles. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out.</p>
